Write C code to work with binary files and visual image data to resize a image and make it become a funny and cute picture!

We can add some cute elements to the two robots. For example:

![dog](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/31902939/48018143-109f7200-e0fe-11e8-8f54-bd1078b0c9d8.jpg)

![rabbit](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/31902939/48020632-6414be80-e104-11e8-8cb1-8564ddf11a5d.jpg)

After resizing the pixel data of an cute element image by a scaling factor given as an argument, 
enter make test on the command line interface in bash, we will get a new super cute picture!
